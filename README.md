I am a masters student at Columbia Univeristy where in the first semester I completed a project for a course "Frameworks and Methods" APAN5200. This project was to find an open source data set and perform exploritory analysis on it to answer specific research questions. My partner and I chose to use a data set found on NYC Open Data website as our inspiration. We found a data set that held the daily counts of individuals in shelters. We used descriptive analysis to explore the data set and complete the project.
